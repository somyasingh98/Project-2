- *Implementation*: Build a Python class to interface with the makeup products API and store the data in a DataFrame.

### Part 3: XML Parsing (World Bank Countries Data)
- *Objective*: Parse the World Bank's robots.txt and sitemap(s), focusing on country data.
- *Implementation*: Create a Python class to process the XML sitemap, extracting relevant country data URLs.
